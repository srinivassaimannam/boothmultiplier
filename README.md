# Booth-s-Multiplication
Booth’s algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that multiplies two signed binary numbers in 2’s compliment notation.
Booth used desk calculators that were faster at shifting than adding and created the algorithm to increase their speed. 
Booth’s algorithm is of interest in the study of computer architecture. Here’s the implememtation of the algorithm in C++.
